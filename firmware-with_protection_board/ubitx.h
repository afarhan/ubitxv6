/**
 * The uBITX is an upconnversion transceiver. The first IF is at 45 MHz.
 * The first IF frequency is not exactly at 45 Mhz but about 5 khz lower,
 * this shift is due to the loading on the 45 Mhz crystal filter by the matching
 * L-network used on it's either sides.
 * The first oscillator works between 48 Mhz and 75 MHz. The signal is subtracted
 * from the first oscillator to arriive at 45 Mhz IF. Thus, it is inverted : LSB becomes USB
 * and USB becomes LSB.
 * The second IF of 11.059 Mhz has a ladder crystal filter. If a second oscillator is used at 
 * 56 Mhz (appox), the signal is subtracted FROM the oscillator, inverting a second time, and arrives 
 * at the 11.059 Mhz ladder filter thus doouble inversion, keeps the sidebands as they originally were.
 * If the second oscillator is at 33 Mhz, the oscilaltor is subtracated from the signal, 
 * thus keeping the signal's sidebands inverted. The USB will become LSB.
 * We use this technique to switch sidebands. This is to avoid placing the lsbCarrier close to
 * 11 MHz where its fifth harmonic beats with the arduino's 16 Mhz oscillator's fourth harmonic
